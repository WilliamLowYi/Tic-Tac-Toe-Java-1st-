# Tic-Tac-Toe-Java-1st-
19.1.20 UK University of Essex Autumn Term Week 1  Just started learn Java, a new concept of programming "Object-Oriented Programming". Trying to make some self project with the help of Google and many Java Fundamental Website. 
This is the first I try to use OOP for self project, don't really know how to make a proper programming. There is no comment/description inside those code.
Sorry about the inconvenience.
